WHAT IS THIS?
=============
This is a gnome-shell extension to hide the legacy tray introduced in
GNOME Shell 3.16. Tray icons are still dealt with by the legacy tray
but are no longer visible.

I wrote this because I never needed to use any legacy tray icons
(Dropbox, Spotify, etc.) and the tray would always pop out and get in
the way when I needed to do something in the bottom left of the
screen.

The extension is licenced under LGPL 2.1 or later.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============
The best way to get this extension is by visiting its page on
extensions.gnome.org: http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/967

If you need to modify the source, then the git repository is the best
solution: http://github.com/jonnylamb/shell-hide-legacy-tray/
Type "make force-install" to install the extension, then follow the
instructions printed on screen.
